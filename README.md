Customer Survival Analysis


Churn analytics is a technique used by telecommunications companies to predict when customers are likely to cancel their contracts and to identify the reasons behind contract terminations. The churn rate is usually expressed as a percentage of customers who cancel their contracts within a given period. Companies use machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of churn. A customer churn analysis is a common classification problem in supervised learning, and involves building a machine learning pipeline to analyze a data set and compare the performance of different model types.
